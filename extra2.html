            <p>
              A hospital is a place where people receive medical care and treatment. It is equipped with doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals who work together to help patients recover from illnesses or injuries. Hospitals have different departments such as emergency, surgery, maternity, pediatrics, and intensive care. Modern hospitals use advanced technology and equipment to diagnose and treat patients efficiently. They also offer services like laboratory testing, X-rays, and physiotherapy. Hospitals play a vital role in saving lives and improving public health. Cleanliness, care, and compassion are key qualities of a good hospital. Whether it's a minor issue or a serious emergency, hospitals are essential for our well-being.
